This repository houses the entire Welcome To My Garden app. Contribution guidelines will be added soon! 

Problems, feedback or questions are welcome in [issues](https://github.com/WelcometoMyGarden/welcometomygarden/issues) or on our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/welcometomygarden/shared_invite/zt-f31i37dj-_zFgnfe40B6EexJuB2f_~w)

## Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version >=10 installed
- This project uses the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) package manager

Create `wtmg.config.json` file and make sure it has the values specified in [`wtmg.config.example.json`](https://github.com/WelcometoMyGarden/welcometomygarden/blob/master/wtmg.config.example.json).

You will need a Mapbox and Maptiler access token if you'd like to work on features that concern the map.

## Roadmap

We urgently need to stop spending so much money on our Google Cloud hosting service (Firebase). A redesign of our website that avoids such extreme cost is needed, or else we need to find a different Node.js hosting provider. Please help us solve this ridiculous problem.

## Usage
From a terminal located at project root, install project dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Start the project in development mode

```
yarn run dev
```
